# Home Assistant S3 Backup

Home Assistant S3 Backup allows for the automated scheduling and synchronization of Home Assistant backups to S3 compatible storage. This addon emerged from my personal need for an S3 based backup solution and is heavily inspired by [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup).

If you're just looking for an easy backup solution for Home Assistant and don't mind using Google Drive you probably want to use [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup) in favor of this. As of now, this addon doesn't match the featureset and reliability of the Google Drive counterpart.

But if S3 is your platform of choice, this addon offers a solution for that purpose!
